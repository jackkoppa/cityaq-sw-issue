# cityAQ

Clone of cityAQ repo, to reproduce original Service Worker issue found there (reported on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48565629/how-to-handle-routing-in-angular-5-service-workers) & in Angular [#21363](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/21636). Even as workarounds are tried on the main repo, the problem will remain visible on this GitHub pages: jackkoppa.github.io/cityaq-sw-issue
